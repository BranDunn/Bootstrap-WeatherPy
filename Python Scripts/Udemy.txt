## Instructions

#Create a Python application that reads the data on Udemy Web Development offerings. 
import os
import csv

csvpath = os.path.join('..', 'Resources', 'web_starter.csv')

#"read" =  open and loop through rows
with open(web_starter.csv, newline="") as csvfile:
    web_starter = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")

    for row in csvreader:

#Then store the contents of the Title, Price, Subscriber Count, Number of Reviews, and Course Length into Python Lists.
        (row[1]) 
#Then zip these lists together into a single tuple.

# Finally, write the contents of your extracted data into a CSV. Make sure to include the titles of these columns in your csv.

## Notes:

# Windows user may get an `UnicodeDecodeError`, to avoid this file pass in `encoding="utf8"` as an additional parameter when reading in the file.

# As, with many datasets, the file does not include the header line. Use the below as a guide on the columns: "id,title,url,isPaid,price,numSubscribers,numReviews,numPublishedLectures,instructionalLevel,contentInfo,publishedTime"

## Bonus

# Find the percent of subscribers that have also left a review on the course. Include this in your final output.

# Parse the string associated with course length, such that we store it as an integer instead of a string. (i.e. "4 hours" should be converted to 4).
